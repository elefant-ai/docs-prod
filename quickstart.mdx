### How to Use the Client

Once you have downloaded and installed the client, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Open the Client**: Launch the client from your desktop or start menu.
2. **Log In**: Log in with your Microsoft account (the one you use for Minecraft).
3. **Select Game**: Choose the game you wish to join. You may only have one option with a new account.
4. **Join the Server**: Follow the instructions on your app screen to join the server.

### Server Address for Non-Client Users

If you do not want to use the client, you can connect using a standard (non-cracked) Minecraft Java 1.20.2 client. The server address is:

```plaintext
public-beta.mc.elefant.gg
```

### Additional Features
We are constantly adding more functionality to our client, such as customizing your bot, connecting to single-player games, Bedrock support, Linux support, and more. If you have more ideas or would like to be an early tester of any of the above, please post in our Discord.

### Feedback and Support
For any issues, game discussions, or feedback, please post in the tester channel or submit a ticket. Screenshots can also be really helpful.
