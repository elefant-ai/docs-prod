Discover the future of Minecraft with our AI-powered bots! These bots can perform a variety of tasks, from basic movements to complex structure building, making your gaming experience more dynamic and enjoyable.


### Quick Start

    Get started with our Minecraft AI Bots

### What the Bot Can Do Today

Right now, your AI friend (“bot”) can complete some basic tasks such as movements, mining, crafting, farming, fighting, and teleporting to you. They can also create simple structures like a basic house or a wheat farm in survival mode.

We are currently working on a feature that will allow you to ask the bot to build anything you want. Even with cheats, it takes the bot hours to finish one of those buildings, so please be patient. Note that the bot is not aware if it is in creative mode or using cheats.
