Discover the capabilities of your AI-powered bot and learn how to interact with it effectively.

### Basic Tasks

Your AI friend (“bot”) can perform a variety of basic tasks, including:

- **Movements**: Navigate the world, following paths and exploring areas.
- **Mining**: Mine resources such as ores, stones, and other materials.
- **Crafting**: Craft items using the resources it has collected.
- **Farming**: Plant and harvest crops, ensuring a steady supply of food.
- **Fighting**: Engage in combat with hostile mobs to protect you.
- **Teleporting**: Teleport to your location when needed.

### Building Structures

The bot can also create structures, both simple and complex.

#### Simple Structures

In survival mode, the bot can build:

- Basic houses
- Wheat farms

#### Complex Structures

For larger and more complex structures, the bot builds them with cheats enabled (for now). These structures include:

- Stable
- Fishing hut
- Missile launcher
- Apartments
- Skyscraper
- Hotel
- Yacht
- Ship
- The Statue of Liberty
- The Elefant logo

We are currently working on a feature that will allow you to ask the bot to build anything you want. Even with cheats, it takes the bot hours to finish one of those buildings, so please be patient. Note that the bot is not aware if it is in creative mode or using cheats.

### Interacting with the Bot

When talking to the bot, we recommend using **whisper**. Your bot can also interact with other players and bots if there are other people online. You can interact with other people’s bots by mentioning their names in world chat if you are close to them, for example, “Hey JJ_bot, can you get me some logs?”

### Troubleshooting Tips

If your bot gets stuck, here are some troubleshooting tips:

- **Stop Command**: Asking the bot to stop usually solves the problem.
- **Reconnect**: Re-connecting yourself to the server can also help.
- **Whisper**: Use whisper to communicate with the bot for better results.
